**Consider upvoting this notebook if you find it useful üôåüèº**

- [Inference Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alejopaullier/hms-efficientnetb0-pytorch-inference)
- In case you don't want to train the model you can find my dataset with [5-fold trained Efficientnet models](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alejopaullier/hms-efficientnetb0-5-folds) that are the result of running this notebook.

This is the **PyTorch üî• version** of [Chris Deotte EfficientNetB0 Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/efficientnetb0-starter-lb-0-43#Train-DataLoader) give him an upvote too ‚¨ÜÔ∏è!

Your goal in this competition is to detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity. You will develop a model trained on electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from critically ill hospital patients.

In this notebook you will learn how to train a `efficientnet` model for image classification using PyTorch. Hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

### <b><span style='color:#F1A424'>What is an EEG waveform?</span></b>

**EEG** (Electroencephalogram) waveforms are the **patterns of electrical activity generated by the brain**, which are recorded using electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG is a non-invasive method that measures the electrical potentials produced by the firing of neurons in the brain. These electrical potentials are then amplified and displayed as waveforms on a computer or paper.

- **Delta Waves (0.5-4 Hz):** Delta waves are slow-wave patterns associated with deep sleep and certain abnormal brain states. They are usually the dominant waves during deep sleep stages.
- **Theta Waves (4-8 Hz):** Theta waves are associated with drowsiness, relaxation, and the early stages of sleep. They can also be present during deep meditation.
- **Alpha Waves (8-13 Hz):** Alpha waves are dominant when a person is awake but relaxed and not actively processing information. They are commonly seen when a person's eyes are closed.
- **Beta Waves (13-30 Hz):** Beta waves are associated with active, alert, and focused mental activity. They are commonly observed when a person is awake and engaged in cognitive tasks.
- **Gamma Waves (30-100 Hz and above):** Gamma waves are associated with higher cognitive functions, such as perception, learning, and problem-solving. They are not always present and are often associated with specific cognitive tasks.

In this competition, EEG waveforms are 50 seconds long.

### <b><span style='color:#F1A424'>What is a spectogram?</span></b>

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a signal as they vary with time. It is a three-dimensional plot that displays how the frequencies of a signal change over time. Spectrograms are commonly used in signal processing, audio analysis, and other fields to analyze the frequency content of a signal and how it evolves over time.
